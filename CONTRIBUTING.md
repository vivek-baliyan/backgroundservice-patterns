# Contributing to BackgroundService Patterns

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BackgroundService Patterns! This repository helps .NET developers implement production-ready background services that avoid common pitfalls.

## How to Contribute

### üêõ Reporting Issues

Found a problem with the patterns or have a suggestion? Please:

1. **Search existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Provide clear reproduction steps** if reporting a bug
3. **Include relevant context**: .NET version, hosting environment, etc.
4. **Use descriptive titles** that summarize the issue

### üí° Suggesting New Patterns

We welcome new pattern suggestions! Before submitting:

1. **Check if the pattern already exists** in the examples
2. **Describe the problem** the pattern solves
3. **Provide a minimal reproduction** of the issue
4. **Explain the solution** and why it's needed
5. **Consider production implications** (performance, monitoring, etc.)

### üîß Code Contributions

#### Pattern Guidelines

All patterns should follow these principles:

- **Production-ready**: Code should be suitable for production use
- **Well-documented**: Include XML comments and clear explanations
- **Latest standards**: Use modern .NET patterns and conventions
- **Exception handling**: Implement proper error handling strategies
- **Cancellation support**: Respect `CancellationToken` throughout
- **Scope management**: Avoid captive dependencies
- **Health monitoring**: Include health check capabilities

#### Code Style

- Use file-scoped namespaces (C# 10+)
- Follow standard .NET naming conventions
- Include comprehensive XML documentation
- Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` for library code
- Implement proper resource disposal patterns
- Use high-performance logging (`LoggerMessage.Define`)

#### Submission Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b pattern/new-pattern-name`)
3. **Implement your pattern** following the guidelines above
4. **Add comprehensive tests** if applicable
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of the problem and solution
   - Examples of the pattern in use
   - Any breaking changes noted
   - Production considerations documented

### üìù Documentation Improvements

Documentation contributions are always welcome:

- Fix typos or grammatical errors
- Improve code examples
- Add usage scenarios
- Clarify existing explanations
- Translate documentation (future consideration)
